Food Waste and Redistribution App
The Food Waste and Redistribution App is a platform that connects individuals, businesses, and organizations with surplus food to those in need, helping reduce food waste and tackle hunger in local communities. This app enables the donation, collection, and redistribution of food in a simple and efficient way, fostering sustainability and social responsibility.

How It Works
1. User Registration and Profile Creation
Businesses (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) and individuals can sign up and create profiles.
Charities and food banks can also create profiles to receive donations.
Each profile includes information about available food, availability, and location.
2. Food Listing and Donation Process
Food providers (businesses or individuals) list surplus food on the app.
Charities or individuals can browse and claim food donations.
Detailed listings include the type of food, quantity, expiration date, and condition.
3. Food Pickup and Delivery
The app coordinates pickup times between food providers and recipients.
Volunteers or local delivery services are notified to pick up and deliver food to recipients.
Delivery can be arranged for large-scale donations or personal pickups.
4. Rating and Review System
Both food providers and recipients can rate their donation experience.
Positive feedback encourages more users to participate in the donation process.
5. Alerts and Notifications
Food providers are notified of expiring food to encourage timely donation.
Charities and recipients are alerted to new donations based on their needs.
6. Food Safety and Quality Guidelines
The app provides guidelines on ensuring the safe handling and storage of donated food.
